# Over-Chat-Exec
JS Macro uses RecvMessage event adding "%" prefix for direct execute for workers over chat.

Enable Splitter.js as RecvMessage event in JSM for it to work.
Change default master nickname and prefix up to your prefferences.
Example use:

`<Master> % /kill`

`<Worker> /kill`

*Worker died*
